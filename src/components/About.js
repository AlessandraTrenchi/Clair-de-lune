            <p className='noi'>I&lsquo;m Chloe Papadopoulou, a passionate web developer and a dedicated student pursuing my Master&lsquo;s in Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge at the University of Bologna. My journey into the world of web development began with a profound curiosity about how the internet works and a desire to create meaningful digital experiences.

With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I have honed my skills in building responsive and user-friendly websites. My passion for clean and efficient code drives me to continuously explore new technologies and best practices in the ever-evolving field of web development.

When I&lsquo;m not coding or immersed in my studies, you&lsquo;ll often find me exploring the intersections of technology and culture, seeking inspiration from the rich tapestry of the digital world. I believe that the web has the power to transform the way we connect and share information, and I&lsquo;m excited to be a part of that transformation.
